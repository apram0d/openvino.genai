# Install OpenVINO GenAI

OpenVINO GenAI is available for installation via [Archive](https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino_genai/packages/) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openvino-genai/) distributions and supports Linux, Windows and macOS platforms.

To install OpenVINO GenAI, refer to the [Install Guide](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/get-started/install-openvino.html).

To build OpenVINO GenAI library from source, refer to the [Build Instructions](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/blob/master/src/docs/BUILD.md).

:::info
Please make sure that you are following the versions compatibility rules, refer to the [OpenVINO GenAI Dependencies](#openvino-genai-dependencies) for more information.

## System Requirements

OpenVINO GenAI is built on top of OpenVINO Runtime and shares the same system requirements.

Refer to the [OpenVINO System Requirements](https://docs.openvino.ai/2025/about-openvino/release-notes-openvino/system-requirements.html) for more details.

## OpenVINO GenAI Dependencies

OpenVINO GenAI depends on [OpenVINO](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino) and [OpenVINO Tokenizers](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_tokenizers).

When installing OpenVINO GenAI from PyPi, the same versions of OpenVINO and OpenVINO Tokenizers are used (e.g. `openvino==2024.3.0` and `openvino-tokenizers==2024.3.0.0` are installed for `openvino-genai==2024.3.0`).
If you update one of the dependency packages (e.g. `pip install openvino --pre --extra-index-url https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/simple/wheels/nightly`), versions might be incompatible due to different ABI and running OpenVINO GenAI can result in errors (e.g. `ImportError: libopenvino.so.2430: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`).
Having packages version in format `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>.<REVISION>`, only `<REVISION>` part of the full version can be varied to ensure ABI compatibility, while changing `<MAJOR>`, `<MINOR>` or `<PATCH>` parts of the version might break ABI.

GenAI, Tokenizers, and OpenVINO wheels for Linux on PyPI are compiled with `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` to cover a wider range of platforms. In contrast, C++ archive distributions for Ubuntu are compiled with `_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1`. It is not possible to mix different Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs) because doing so results in a link error. This incompatibility prevents the use of, for example, OpenVINO from C++ archive distributions alongside GenAI from PyPI.

If you want to try OpenVINO GenAI with different dependencies versions (**not** prebuilt packages as archives or python wheels), build OpenVINO GenAI library from source.
